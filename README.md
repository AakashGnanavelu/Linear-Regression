# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning to model the relationship between two variables. It is commonly used to solve regression problems, which involve predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables.

Imagine you have a dataset of house prices and you want to predict the price of a new house based on factors such as its size, location, and number of bedrooms. Linear regression can help you to model the relationship between these variables and the price of the house.

In linear regression, the output or dependent variable is a continuous variable, such as the price of the house. The input or independent variables are used to predict the output variable. The linear regression model calculates the relationship between the input variables and the output variable by fitting a straight line through the data.

The linear regression model produces a line that best fits the data points. The line represents the relationship between the input variables and the output variable. The slope of the line represents the change in the output variable for a unit change in the input variable. The intercept of the line represents the value of the output variable when the input variable is zero.

Once the model is trained on a dataset, it can be used to predict the output variable for new observations. The model uses the input variables to calculate the predicted value of the output variable based on the equation of the line.

Overall, linear regression is a powerful tool for solving regression problems and predicting the relationship between two variables. It can be used to model a wide range of phenomena, from house prices to stock prices to scientific measurements.
